Now working on v2.
Problems with V1:

1. Terminal block pin width? - Leave at metric
2. One-shot Vdd should be Arduino_voltage 
3. RTC VCC should be arduino_voltage 
4. Reset circuit only works when 5 volt is on
5. Add signal for USB4000 trigger
6. Changed battery voltage dividers
7. Double check reset button
8. Replace Sparfun RTC with RTC and battery on PCB
9. Label test points
